PROJECT_NAME           = Break Out Project, By Luis Bechara

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "POST MORTEM: Getting the game was a long process of figuring out c++ and SDL among other things such as understanding patterns. However I am satisfied of the initial result as a close-to-be MVP, it can be improved on futher by: 1- Encapsoluting all the game logic inside respective objects instead of the main fuction. 2- Create a SceneManager to load each instance as a child of a GameObject class. 3- Encasoluting all the Draw and SDL behaivior in a Renderer class that knows how the draw each object on screen to follow a more conventional MVC. also the game can be extended as follows. 1- writting more levels files. 2- enabling progression between levels and more clear game states. 3- enabling more localization files"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style 
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc 
# comments will behave just like regular Qt-style comments 
# (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief description.)

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. 
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

# configuration options related to the input files

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank the following patterns are tested: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to turn specify whether or not subdirectories
