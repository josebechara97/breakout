# breakout

A breakout game built in c++

Getting the game was a long process of figuring out c++ and SDL among other things such as understanding patterns. However I am satisfied of the initial result as a close-to-be MVP, it can be improved on futher by:

 

1- Encapsoluting all the game logic inside respective objects instead of the main fuction

2- Create a SceneManager to load each instance as a child of a GameObject class

3- Encasoluting all the Draw and SDL behaivior in a Renderer class that knows how the draw each object on screen to follow a more conventional MVC

 

also the game can be extended as follows

1- writting more levels files

2- enabling progression between levels and more clear game states

3- enabling more localization files
